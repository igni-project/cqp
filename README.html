<h2 id="cqp-introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Collision Query Protocol (CQP) is an application-layer communication protocol built to allow interactivity between processes in a 3-dimensional space.</p> 

<h2 id="cqp-requests">3. Requests</h2>

<p>A request is a message sent from a client to a CQP server. Requests consist of an 8-bit request code followed by the requests data, which varies in size.</p>

<p>Various types of requests are assigned unique numbers. From these numbers, a program reading a request may extrapolate the purpose of the request and structure of the requests contents. This number is referred to as a ‘request code’ and is 8 bits in size.</p>

<h2 id="cqp-cast-point">3.1. Cast Point</h2>

<p>The ‘cast point’ request queries whether a point at a given location intersects a hitbox. This request has a code of 0.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Size (bytes)</th>
		<th>Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>X location</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Y location</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Z location</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The ‘cast point’ request consists of 3 floating-point integers: the X, Y and Z location of the point to be cast, in that order.</p>

<h2 id="cqp-cast-ray">3.2. Cast Ray</h2>

<p>A ‘cast ray’ request queries whether a straight, infinite line of specified origin and vector intersects a hitbox. This request has a code of 1.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Size (bytes)</th>
		<th>Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>X origin</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Y origin</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Z origin</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>X vector</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Y vector</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>float</td>
		<td>Z vector</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The ‘cast ray’ request consists of 2 sets of floating-point X-Y-Z coordinates: the origin of the ray, followed by its vector. Both sets of coordinates are 3-dimensional, and are ordered X first, Y second and Z third.</p>

<h2 id="cqp-authors-notes">4. Authors Notes</h2>
<p>Originally titled ‘Hitbox Update Protocol’, the protocol has recently gone through an overhaul that substantially simplified its design.</p>

<p>Previously, a central server would hold all hitboxes and process all collisions between them. Clients would send requests to the server to modify hitboxes, in a similar fashion to the Scene Update Protocol.</p>

<p>The redesign, however, places the tasks of storing hitboxes and computing collisions on the clients. All a CQP server does is forward each message it receives to all its clients.</p>
